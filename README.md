# handel_messiah_schirmer-1912-22945
Project to transcribe the score for the George Frideric Handel work, 
Messiah, HWV 56, 
arranged by Friedrich Chrysander, piano reduction by T. Tertius Noble and Max Spicker, 
published G. Schirmer in 1912, plate 22945.

We will transcribe the "Hallelujah" chorus first, then move on to the rest of the score.

The reference score is [IMSLP11870-Handel_Messiah_Schirmer_1912.pdf](http://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/11870), available from [IMSLP](http://imslp.org/).  

Other useful sources:
* [IMSLP343283-PMLP22568-IMSLP11870-Handel_Messiah_Schirmer_1912-bars.pdf](http://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/343283) appears to be the same as our reference score IMSLP11870, but it has measure numbers added on some movements. This will make it easier to proofread. But IMSLP11870 is the reference, if there is a conflict.
* https://github.com/nsceaux/nenuvar/tree/master/Haendel/Oratorio/Messiah is a Lilypond format transcription of a different edition of _Messiah_, by [Ã‰ditions Nicolas Sceaux](http://nicolas.sceaux.free.fr/). Sceaux appears to license with a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License](https://github.com/nsceaux/nenuvar/blob/master/common/common.ily#L55), which might be too inflexible for the Keyboard Philharmonic goals. However, past editions have used the more flexible Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.  If the licence is compatible, the next question is whether a Lilypond to MusicXML converter can do a good job with this score.

The license for this project will be either CC0 or CC-BY, and when that's decided, we'll add a LICENCE file.
